    <h4>
      1<a id='tos1' name='tos1'>.</a> Your relationship with BushWise
    </h4>
    <h5>1.1</h5>
    <p>
    Your use of BushWise's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the &#8220;Services&#8221; in this document and excluding any services provided to you by BushWise under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and BushWise. &#8220;BushWise&#8221; means BushWise Hosting Ltd, whose principal place of business is at Trym Lodge, 1 Henbury Road, Westbury-on-Trym, City of Bristol, BS9 3HQ, United Kingdom. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.
    </p>
    <h5>1.2</h5>
    <p>
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing with BushWise, your agreement with BushWise will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the &#8220;Universal Terms&#8221;.
    </p>
    <h5>1.3</h5>
    <p>
    Your agreement with BushWise will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the &#8220;Additional Terms&#8221;. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
    </p>
    <h5>1.4</h5>
    <p>
    The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and BushWise in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the &#8220;Terms&#8221;.
    </p>
    <h5>1.5</h5>
    <p>
    If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.
    </p>
    <h4>
      2<a id='tos2' name='tos2'>.</a> Accepting the Terms
    </h4>
    <h5>2.1</h5>
    <p>
    In order to use the Services, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.
    </p>
    <h5>2.2</h5> 
    <p>
    You can accept the Terms by:
    </p>
    <ol class='alphaL'>
    <li>
      clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by BushWise in the user interface for any Service; or
    </li><li>
      by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that BushWise will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>2.3</h5>
    <p>
    You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if: 
    </p>
    <ol class='alphaL'>
    <li>
      you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with BushWise, or 
    </li><li>
      you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United Kingdom or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>2.4</h5>
    <p>
    Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.
    </p>
    <h4>
      3<a id='tos3' name='tos3'>.</a> Language of the Terms
    </h4>
    <h5>3.1</h5>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h5>3.2</h5>
    <p>
    If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.
    </p>

      4<a id='tos4' name='tos4'>.</a> Provision of the Services by BushWise
    </h4>
    <h5>4.1</h5>
    <p>
    BushWise has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (&#8220;Subsidiaries and Affiliates&#8221;).

You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.
    </p>
    <h5>4.2</h5>
    <p>

    </h4>
    <h5>8.1</h5> 
    <p>
    You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the &#8220;Content&#8221;.
    </p>
    <h5>8.2</h5>
    <p>
    You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to BushWise (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by BushWise or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.
    </p>
    <h5>8.3</h5>
    <p>
    BushWise reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.

    <h4>
      9<a id='tos9' name='tos9'>.</a> Proprietary Rights
    </h4>
    <h5>9.1</h5>
    <p>
    You acknowledge and agree that BushWise (or BushWise's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by BushWise and that you shall not disclose such information without BushWise's prior written consent.
    </p>
    <h5>9.2</h5>

    </p>
    <h5>9.3</h5>
    <p>

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with BushWise, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that BushWise has no obligation to do so on your behalf.
    </p>
    <h5>9.5</h5>
    <p>
    You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.

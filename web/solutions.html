    <h3>Business or Personal Standard WebSite Hosting</h3>
    <p>
    <span class='shoutBoxL'>
      What is Standard Hosting?
    </span>
    We laughingly call this &#8220;The Standard Hosting&#8221; Solution. Amusing because it is far from &#8220;basic&#8221; or any other thoughts that spring to mind regarding a &#8220;standard&#8221; service. All our hosted Sites come with a broad range of available modules allowing any client to manage their Site as they see fit. Your Site can grow, if, and when, you decide to add more content or different areas. We are aware not everyone wishes to have or maintain an all &#8220;bells and whistles&#8221; concern. Our Standard Hosting Solution will cater for a personal Site with only a handful of pages to be easily created, updated and managed, or also allow a Company or other business venture a presence on the Internet that need not be huge or overly dynamic. All sites, regardless of nature are Database driven which enables us to provide you with the <a href='cms_indx.html' title='CMS Hosting Details'>Content Management System</a> - <abbr title='Content Management System'>CMS</abbr>, which controls your Site. This is a very powerful tool and explains, in part, why our so called &#8220;Standard Hosting&#8221; package is not so standard&#8230;

      What is eCommerce?
    </span>
    <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce</a> is about setting up your business on the Internet, allowing visitors to access your WebSite, and go through a virtual catalogue of your products and/or services Online. When a potential client wants to buy something s|he likes, they merely add it to their virtual shopping basket. Items in the shopping basket can be added, edited or deleted, and when the list is satisfactorily complete they can opt to continue the process by entering the virtual checkout page. This has a Grand Total including shipping and handling charges if applicable. It will then ask them for name, shipping address etc. and a method of payment (usually Credit Card). Once they have entered all this information which is being <a href='security.html' title='Security Details'>transmitted securely</a>, the client then awaits delivery. Our <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce Software</a> can encompass all of the topics mentioned thus far and many more. <a href='bookings_indx.html' title='Bookings Hosting'>Online Bookings</a> is one example of how our <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce Suite</a> can be developed to suit <b>any</b> needs may you have. In short, by implementing <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce</a>, you save money, have a presence Online <b>24</b> hours a day, <b>7</b> days a week, <b>365</b> days a year. No traffic jams, manic shopping crowds, heavy bags etc. Just increased business in an easier and more accessible manner.

    <h3>Online Bookings Systems, allowing bookings &amp; payment Online</h3>
    <p>
    <span class='shoutBoxL'>
      What is an Online Booking System?
    </span>
    An <b>Online Bookings System</b> will allow you to attract clients and take payment along with booking details. All run from your own WebSite hosted by us. By using our <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce Suite</a> in conjunction with our <a href='cms_indx.html' title='CMS Hosting Details'>Content Management System</a> Software you can create a WebSite to draw custom to your <i>Bricks and Mortar</i> business - whatever it may be, enabling you to also become a <i>Clicks and Order</i> operation. Whilst primarily set up with Lodges, Hotels &amp; Restaurants in mind there is no reason the Software cannot be utilised for many other business concerns. The only limit is your imagination. If you run <b>any</b> type of business where allowing potential clients to book Online for your services would be of benefit, then this could well be the solution to meet your needs.

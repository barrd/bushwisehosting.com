    <h3>Can eCommerce help you to enhance your business?</h3>

    <span class='shoutBoxL'>
      What is eCommerce?
    </span>
    <b>eCommerce</b> is about establishing your business on the Internet, allowing visitors to access your WebSite, and go through a virtual catalogue of your products and/or services Online. When a potential client wants to purchase something s|he likes, they would add it to their virtual shopping basket. Items in that shopping basket can be added, edited or removed, and when their list is satisfactorily complete they can opt to continue the process by entering the virtual checkout page. This has a Grand Total including shipping and handling charges if applicable. It will then ask them for name, shipping address etc. and a method of payment ( usually a Credit Card ). Once they have entered all this information which is being <a href='security.html' title='Security Details'>transmitted securely</a>, the client then awaits delivery. It's that simple, in theory anyway... The reality, which we cover in this document, will hopefully dispell some of the myths surrounding Electronic Commerce.
    </p>
    <h4>It's not just about Online Shops...</h4>
    <p>
    <b>eCommerce</b> is not just about Online shops, it's about anything and everything to do with money. If you make payments via cheques, Direct Debit, Credit Cards, etc. Electronic Commerce <b>will</b> make an appearance in your life sooner or later. Banks and other financial establishments are now giving their clients accessibility to their accounts via the Web and more businesses are establishing Online facilities every day. In short, by implementing <b>eCommerce</b>, you save money, have a presence Online <b>24</b> hours a day, <b>7</b> days a week, <b>365</b> days a year. No traffic jams, manic shopping crowds, heavy bags etc. just increased business in an easier and more accessible manner.

    <h3>Is the Web &#8220;safe&#8221; for collecting Personal and Credit Card details?</h3>
    <p>
    <span class='shoutBoxL'>
      Is the Web safe for eCommerce?
    </span>
    This is a question we get asked a lot, so, just how safe is the Web? The answer to that is a long one and not as simple or clear cut as some would have you believe. Lets try and answer some questions as easily and succinctly as possible... With the appropriate security and preventitive systems in place, add in a dash of common sense and trust that we will do our job correctly the Web <b>can</b> be a safe place to do business and we take our security issues <b>very seriously</b>. To this end we assess our business partners very carefully, ensuring that their security policies are as tight as ours and that no personal details are stored anywhere that contravene our <a href='privacy.html' title='BWH Privacy Policy'>Privacy Policy</a>. As for Credit Card details, they are <b>never... ever... ever...</b> stored. That means, Databases, whether <acronym title='Structured Query Language'>SQL</acronym> or flatfile, pieces of paper, eMail receipts, <acronym title='Extensible Markup Language'>XML</acronym> transaction files, buffered <acronym title='Transport Control Protocol / Internet Protocol'>TCP / IP</acronym> packets... <b>nada, nothing, not ever</b>. Think that about covers everything to do with the storing of Credit Cards question? If not, then please <a href='contact.html' title='Contact Us'>drop us a line</a> to ask your question.
    </p>
    <h4>How the live Credit Card transactions work...</h4>
    <p>
    A quick explanation of how the live Credit Card transactions work follows; A potential client would enter their details in a <a href='security.html' title='Security Details'>secure</a> virtual checkout page. Upon transmission of the order a secure <acronym title='Secure Socket Layer'>SSL</acronym> link is established between our server and the finacial partner handling the order. The client's account is then debited by the appropriate amount and the order is processed in the background out of sight of any eyes whether malicious or not. At no time can anyone see, tamper with or record the Credit Card details. We store the client's name, address and order details for future reference which is also a legal requirement. The particulars surrounding the stored data is covered at some length in our <a href='privacy.html' title='BWH Privacy Policy'>Privacy Policy</a>.

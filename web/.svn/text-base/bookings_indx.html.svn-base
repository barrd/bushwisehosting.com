    <h2>BWH - Online Bookings Hosting</h2>
    <h3>Can an Online Bookings Solution help your business?</h3>
    <p>
    <span class='shoutBoxL'>
      What is an Online Booking System?
    </span>
    An <b>Online Bookings</b> Solution will allow you to attract clients and take payment along with booking details. All run from your own WebSite hosted by us. By using our <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce Suite</a> in conjunction with our <a href='cms_indx.html' title='CMS Hosting Details'>Content Management System</a> Software you can create a WebSite to draw custom to your <i>Bricks and Mortar</i> business - whatever it may be, enabling you to also become a <i>Clicks and Order</i> operation. Whilst primarily set up with Lodges, Hotels &amp; Restaurants in mind there is no reason the Software cannot be utilised for many other business concerns. The only limit is your imagination. If you run <b>any</b> type of business where allowing potential clients to book Online for your services would be of benefit, then this could well be the solution to meet your needs.
    </p>
    <h4>Services Vs. Physical Products as a selling point.</h4>
    <p>
    The Software is as flexible and extensible as any reasonable project could ask for. For example, taking Online &#8220;live&#8221; payment is an option, not a necessity. You may pick and choose what <b>you</b> want the Software to do... <b>not</b> the other way round. This is essentially an offshoot of the <a href='ecommerce_indx.html' title='eCommerce Hosting'>eCommerce Suite</a> with <i>Services</i> being the main focus rather than <i>physical objects</i>. The overall product, its workings etc. are exactly the same with the same results besides. You just cut out the need for post &amp; packing and all the other associated aspects of selling 'real, physical' goods.
    </p>
    <h4>Calendar functionality for sharing between you and your client.</h4>
    <p>
    Your Online Bookings Suite will come complete with a calendar that you and the potential client can use to establish dates for when a booking is to be made. With due care and frequent updates by you, the client can establish what is on offer and when it is available. This would be especially important if you where to opt for the &#8220;live&#8221; Credit Card sale option. The system can be as complex or simple as you require it to be. So, put on your thinking cap and ask yourself &#8220;can this help me to improve my business?&#8221;
